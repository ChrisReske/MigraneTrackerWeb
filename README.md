A web application to log migrane attacks.

## Motivation

Keeping track of migrane attacks and their circumstances. Most therapies still rely on filling out sheets of paper to be read and analysed by the specialist doctor. However, co-occurrences or root causes might not be spotted when analysing data from paper sheets. Additionally, I wanted to include weather data as a feature, because I know that the weather does affect my health. Adding weather data on paper would be very tedious. Moreover, current phone apps do not take into account weather data, either. This brings me to the next point: Current apps lack some features I deem valuable. Moreover, some apps do not even feature data exports to human readable formats.

Please do note that this is a work in progress. The application is currently not running and needs some serious refactoring.
